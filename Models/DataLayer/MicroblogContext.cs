In this post, I’ll share my journey of how I successfully developed a blog website using .NET.\r\n\r\nPlanning: Before starting any development work, it’s important to plan out the project. I spent time researching and deciding on the features and functionality I wanted to include in my blog website.\r\n\r\nChoosing the right tools: .NET offers a wide range of tools and technologies for web development. I chose to use ASP.NET Core for my blog website because it’s a modern, fast, and scalable framework.\r\n\r\nDesigning the architecture: With the features and tools decided, I designed the architecture of my blog website. This included deciding on the data models, database design, and overall structure of the application.\r\n\r\nImplementing the features: With the architecture in place, I started implementing the features of my blog website. This included creating the user interface, setting up authentication and authorization, and implementing the core functionality such as creating and managing blog posts.\r\n\r\nTesting and debugging: As with any development project, testing and debugging were an important part of the process. I tested my blog website thoroughly to ensure that everything was working as expected and fixed any issues that arose.\r\n\r\nDeploying: Once everything was tested and working correctly, I deployed my blog website to a hosting provider. This made it accessible to the public and allowed me to start sharing my content with the world.\r\n\r\nDeveloping a blog website using .NET was a challenging but rewarding experience. By following a structured approach and using the right tools and technologies, I was able to successfully create a functional and attractive blog website.",

You can download the Community edition for free from the official Visual Studio website.\r\n\r\nCreate a new project: Once you have Visual Studio installed, open it and create a new project. Select File > New > Project... from the menu, then choose ASP.NET Web Application (.NET Framework) from the list of templates.\r\n\r\nChoose the MVC template: After selecting the ASP.NET Web Application (.NET Framework) template, you’ll be prompted to choose a specific template for your project. Choose the MVC template and click OK.\r\n\r\nConfigure the project: After choosing the MVC template, you’ll be taken to the New ASP.NET Web Application dialog. Here you can configure various settings for your project, such as authentication options and target framework version. Make any changes as needed and click OK to create the project.\r\n\r\nExplore the project: Once the project is created, take some time to explore it and familiarize yourself with its structure. You’ll see that Visual Studio has automatically generated several files and folders for you, including controllers, views, and models.\r\n\r\nBy following these steps, you’ll have successfully set up an ASP.NET MVC project in Visual Studio and will be ready to start developing your web application.",

It serves as an object-relational mapper (O/RM), enabling .NET developers to work with a database using .NET objects and eliminating the need for most of the data-access code that typically needs to be written ².\r\n\r\nSome of the advantages of EF Core include:\r\n\r\n- **Support for multiple database engines**: EF Core supports many database engines, including SQL Server/Azure SQL Database, SQLite, Azure Cosmos DB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and many more through a database provider plugin model ³.\r\n\r\n- **LINQ support**: EF Core allows developers to write LINQ (Language Integrated Query) queries to work with data using objects of domain-specific classes instead of the underlying database tables and columns where this data is stored ¹.\r\n\r\n- **Reduced development time and cost**: EF Core provides auto-generated code and allows developers to visually design models and mapping of databases. This can help reduce development time and cost ⁴.\r\n\r\n- **Unit of Work implementation**: EF Core provides Unit of Work (UOW) implementation out of the box ¹.\r\n\r\n- **Data binding friendly**: EF Core is data binding friendly ¹.\r\n\r\n- **Fast CRUD operations**: EF Core helps to perform fast CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in .NET applications ¹.\r\n\r\nThese are just some of the many advantages that EF Core offers over other frameworks. Its versatility and ease-of-use make it a popular choice for .NET developers.\r\n\r\n---\r\nSource: Conversation with Bing, 6/20/2023\r\n1.
